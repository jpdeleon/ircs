Description: # IRCS
        Command-line implementation of basic data reduction of near-infrared images with polarimetry.
        The data is from the infrared camera and spectrograph (IRCS) instrument on board the 8-m Subaru telescope in Hawaii.
        
        ## Progress
        2017/03/20: basic scripting
        2017/04/24: created setup.py
        2017/04/26: added crop and bgsub
        2017/04/28: added calflat.py
        
        ## Installation
        This assumes that you have an environment with at least python 2.7 installed.
        If not, use conda to create an environment called `ircs_pol`:
        ```shell
        conda create -n ircs_pol python-2.7 matplotlib numpy
        source activate ircs_pol
        
        
        Now, clone and then install `ircs`  inside the environment:
        
        1. Clone this repository
        ```shell
        git clone git@github.com:jpdeleon/ircs.git
        
        
        2. `cd` into the proper directory and install
        ```shell
        cd /ircs
        python setup.py install
        
        
        ## Sample run
        
        ### Part 1 ircs-imaging
        ```shell
        $ ircs-imaging -h
        
        
        ### Part 2 ircs-polarimetry
        ```shell
        $ ircs-polarimetry -h
        
        
        See also other plotting helper functions in /ircs/utils.py.
        
        TO DO: 
        1. define input/output directories using a .yaml
        2. implement low-level control
        3. upgrade to classes
